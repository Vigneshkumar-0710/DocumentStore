# DocumentStore

Build an utility that allows the user to manage documents in a File like system stored in Memory, that supports the following:

1. The user can add a document at a particular path.
2. The user can search for a document with the full path or for documents with a path prefix.

Bonus:

1. Implement another function that allows deletion.
2. Turn this to a commandline software that asks for prompts when running.
3. Supports some kind of autocomplete where I type `my/` and it suggests `my/only` as a possible option.
